<h1 class="project">Project Stabilizer</h1>

<p>
  It is an initiative by FOT (Fields of Tomorrow) with an aim to provide
  stabilizers in areas where farmers are deprived of electricity. It is
  significantly helpful to farmers as it directly addresses one of the critical
  challenges they face: inconsistent and unreliable electricity. By providing
  stabilizers, the project ensures that farmers can rely on their electrical
  equipment, leading to improved efficiency and productivity.
